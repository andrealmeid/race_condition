# Race Condition

A racing game.

### Dependencies

So far, just a modern web browser and Python.

### Running

For CORS' reasons, we need to run a web server. Try this:

```
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

### FAQ

- Why?

Because simulating an over-the-horizon radar is too complex.

### TODO:

- Client/Server communication
- Race recording and playback through keyframes
- Synchronization between all clients through keyframes + timestamps
- Racing stuff: which car is in first place? who won? how long did it take?
- Leaderboard
- More cars, improve visuals
